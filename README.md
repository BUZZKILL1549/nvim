Hello there. This is a little repo that contains a simple configuration
for Neovim. It uses as few plugins as possible to create an easy-to-use
and easy-to-configure system while still being fun to use, at least for
me. 

It uses the following plugins:
- nvim-cmp and its dependencies for completion
- catppuccin colorscheme
- dashboard-nvim for dashboard
- gitsigns to make cool green bars on thee gutter
- nvim-lspconfig
- lualine
- mason.nvim for managing language servers
- lazy.nvim as a plugin manager
- telescope.nvim as a fuzzy-finder
- nvim-treesitter for treesitting business
